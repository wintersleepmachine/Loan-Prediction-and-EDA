# Loan-Prediction-and-EDA

This repository contains a jupyter notebook of exploring the different variables that goes into loan approvals. Some questions I answer are:
 1. Is there differences between loan approval ratings between genders?
 2. Loan approvals for married and non-married?
 3. Self employed vs not
 4. Education levels, applicant's income and credit history?
 5. The ratios between loan amount vs applicant's income and loan approval status
 
 
Using Sklearn ML API built a binary classifier to predict loan approval status. Acheived an accuracy rate of 91% and a precision of 89%. Used that model in a deployable ML full stack application to predict probability of loan approval status.
